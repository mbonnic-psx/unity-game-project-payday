## Overview

- PayDay is a short first person horror survival game created for the Brackeys 7 day game jam 2025.2.
- The theme behind this game jam was "Risk it for the Biscuit".
- As the player you play as a robber attemping to score big at a late night antique store, but as you go in and try to take the money the store owner warns you of your mistake and the lights cut out.
- At this point you must decide do you risk taking the money around the store and get caught or do you escape with not much money in your pockets.
